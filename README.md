# Final Year Project: Simulation and Analysis of Antenna Used for AR/VR Application

This repository contains the final year engineering project titled *"Simulation and Analysis of Antenna Used for AR/VR Applications". The project involves the design, simulation, and analysis of a **slotted square microstrip patch antenna* intended for *millimeter-wave (mmWave)* operation at *26 GHz, suitable for applications in **Augmented Reality (AR)* and *Virtual Reality (VR)*.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design a compact, efficient microstrip patch antenna at 26 GHz.
- Simulate antenna behavior using industry-standard electromagnetic simulation software.
- Evaluate critical performance parameters like Return Loss, Gain, VSWR, and Radiation Pattern.
- Optimize the antenna design for better suitability in wearable and AR/VR devices.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- *Ansys HFSS* – for electromagnetic simulation and 3D modeling.
- *MATLAB* (optional) – for signal processing and plotting (if used).
- *Microsoft Word / LaTeX* – for documentation and report writing.
